In this lesson, we learned how to set up Postgres locally and on ElephantSQL. We also learned how to conduct basic CRUD operations with SQL, and learned how to work with foreign keys and joins to model many-to-one/one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

If you're unclear on any of the above, be sure to follow up with your mentor.
