In this stand alone module, you'll learn how to model and persist data using PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database, and Sequelize, a library for integrating SQL databases into our Node apps.

This module assumes that you've already worked learned how Mongo and Mongoose, and that you know how to set up and run integration tests and continuous integration, as taught in the main Node course.
