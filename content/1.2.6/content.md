In this lesson, you learned how to use Sequelize in Express apps. Moving forward, you should feel comfortable:

* Modeling your data using Sequelize.
* Using SQL scripts to migrate your data your apps to use Mongoose.
* Writing integration tests for apps that use Sequelize.
* Deploying Sequelize apps to Heroku and using ElephantSQL to host the database.

If you're uncomfortable with any of these, be sure to touch base with your mentor.
